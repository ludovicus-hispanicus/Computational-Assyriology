    "Goal of this notebook is to transform [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es/) data into a structured format that clearly distinguishes between text and non-text (such as line numbers) and that, for the text part, follows as much as possible the standards of the Oracc Global Sign List ([OGSL](http://oracc.org/ogsl)). In section [2.4.2](2.4.2) we will use this structured data to build a search engine that is independent of sign readings (that is, searching for **sukkal**, **sugal₇** or **luh** will all yield the same results). The search engine will serve as an example of the potential power of mashing two independent projects.\n",

Other data available in such lines (such as publication and [CDLI](http://cdli.ucla.edu) P-number) are omitted, because they are better derived from the catalog file.\n",

Editorial remarks (which may indicate the presence of a seal impression, an erased line, or provide an alternative reading) are introduced by the hash mark and are placed at the end of the line. A specific type of editorial remark is the sign name, which explains an x-value (see below section [2.4.1.4.1](2.4.1.4.1)), a rare sign form, or a rare sign reading.

We then prefix each line with the [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es) number that was isolated previously, and with a counter (`id_line`) that is set to zero for each new document.

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A peculiarity of the [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es) data set is the way so-called x-values are represented. In Assyriology, x-values are sign readings that have not (yet) received a conventional index number. For instance, the (very common) word  for \"to cut (reeds)\" is written either with the sign **zi** or with the sign **SIG₇**. Based on the distribution of those spellings (**SIG₇** only in Umma, **zi** elsewhere), M. Molina and M. Such-Guttiérez (2004)[^2] concluded that both spellings write the same word /**zi**/. On that basis the new reading **/zi/** for the sign **SIG₇** was introduced (and is now commonly accepted among Sumerologists). In such cases one may transliterate **ziₓ(SIG₇)** where the SIG₇ between brackets is the name of the sign transliterated as **ziₓ** (and thus the principle of a one-to-one mapping of a transliterated token to a cuneiform sign is maintained). In the [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es) export file this is represented as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "> \to. 2     gi ziX-a 12 sar-⌈ta⌉ (=SIG7)\t\tcut reed per 12 *sar* of field\n",
    "\n",
    "The index ₓ is represented by a capital X (as in ziX), and the sign name is added at the end of the line, between parens and preceded by the equal sign. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use this data for computational purposes (for instance computing sign frequencies) it is necessary to move the sign specification and to transform this into\n",
    "\n",
    "> \to. 2     gi ziₓ(SIG7)-a 12 sar-⌈ta⌉ \n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to do so with a script or regular expression, and to move the sign name to the position immediately after the capital X. Before we do so, it is useful to inspect some exceptions to the pattern. In some cases sign names are provided for rare readings, for instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \t18 gin2 nagga mu-kuX gibil (=AN.NA) (=DU)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we naively move the first sign name to the first X, we will get:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \t18 gin2 nagga mu-kuX(AN.NA) gibil  (=DU)\n",
    "\n",
    "(=AN.NA), in this case, explains the rare reading **nagga** (tin, or some similar substance), whereas (=DU) explains **kuX** - but there is no obvious way for a regular expression or script to recognize that. Another type of exception is reduplicated \"gurₓ-gurₓ\" (to reap) which is represented thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 6.0.0 še ur5-ra še gurX-gurX-ta su-ga (=ŠE.KIN.ŠE.KIN)\n",

    "> \t6.0.0 še ur5-ra še gurₓ(ŠE.KIN.ŠE.KIN)-gurₓ-ta su-ga\n",
    "\n",

In some cases, x-values have been assigned an index number in [OGSL](http://oracc.org/ogsl). In those cases (nigarₓ = nigar; nemurₓ(PIRIG.TUR) = nemur₂; nagₓ(GAZ) = nag₃; and pešₓ(ŠU.PEŠ5) = peš₁₄) the appropriate index number should be added and the sign name ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary of such unambiguous x-values (`xvalues`) has as its key the x-value as represented in [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es) in lower case ('zix') and as its value the index ₓ plus the appropriate sign name ('ₓ(IGI@g)') in [OGSL](http://oracc.org/ogsl) format.\n",

    "```{admonition} OGSL Sign Names\n",
    ":class: dropdown, tip\n",
    "[OGSL](http://oracc.org/ogsl) uses a set of standard sign names. What is represented as SIG7 in [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es) has the name IGI@g in [OGSL](http://oracc.org/ogsl). In IGI@g the element @g is an abbreviation for the (Akkadian) word *gunû*, which was used by ancient scribal scholars to describe a sign with extra hatching. IGI: 𒅆; IGI@g: 𒅊. Other such markers are @t (*tenû*) for a slanted sign and @š (*šeššig*) for a sign with additional wedges inscribed. The 'times' sign (×) is used to describe a sign that consists of a container sign, inscribed with another sign (as in |KA×GAR| 𒅥). In [OGSL](http://oracc.org/ogsl) such compound signs are demarcated by pipes.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The substitution is done with a somewhat complex [regular expression](https://www.regular-expressions.info/), that looks as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "row['text'] = re.sub(xv, lambda m: m.group()[:-1] + xvalues.get(m.group().translate(table).lower(), 'X'), row['text'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `sub()` function of the `re` library has the general form `re.sub(search_pattern, replace, string)`. Instead of a replace string, one may also give a function (in this case a temporary `lambda` function) that returns the `replace` string. The `lambda` function queries the dictionary `xvalues` to see if the match that was found in the search pattern is present among the keys. The basic format of that command is `xvalues.get(m.group())`, where `m.group()` represents the current match of the search pattern. The search pattern, `xv` (to be explained in more detail below) may match `zahX`, `NigarX`, or `[bu]lugX` - in other words, the match may include capitals (as in `NigarX`) or brackets and flags (as in `[bu]lugX`). In order to find that match in the dictionary it is lowercased and \"translated\". The function `translate()` translates individual characters into other characters - according to a translation pattern in a table. In this case, the characters representing flags and brackets are all translated to `None` which means, in practice, that they are removed. The matches `zahX`, `NigarX`, and `[bu]lugX`, therefore, will be looked up in the dictionary as `zahx`, `nigarx`, and `bulugx` - and each of those are indeed keys in `xvalues`. In the `get()` function one may optionally add a fall-back value in case the key is not found - in this case the fall-back is 'X'. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a match is found, say `[bu]lugX`, the key `bulugx` is found in the dictionary `xvalues`, returning `ₓ(|ŠIM×KUŠU₂|)`. The return value of the lambda function is the search match (`[bu]lugX`) minus the last character (`[bu]lug`) plus the value that was returned from the dictionary (`ₓ(|ŠIM×KUŠU₂|)`), resulting in `[bu]lugₓ(|ŠIM×KUŠU₂|)`. If the search pattern returns a match that is not found in the dictionary (for instance `ušurX`), the return value of the lambda function is, again, the search match (`ušurX`), minus the last character (`ušur`) plus `X`, the fallback return of the `get()` function, resulting in `ušurX`. In other words - in those cases the search match is replaced by itself and nothing changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The search pattern is a compiled regex (compiled expressions are faster than expressions that need to be interpreted on the fly), `xv`, which is defined as\n",
    "```python\n",
    "xv = re.compile(r'[\\w' + re.escape(flags) + ']+X')\n",
    "```\n",
    "This matches any sequence of one or more (`+`) word-characters (`\\w`; this includes letters from the English alphabet as well as special characters such as š, ṣ, and ṭ, the digits 0-9, and the underscore) and/or flags (such as square brackets etc.; see below: Flags), followed by a capital X. This regex will match `ziX`, `zahX`, or `ušurX`, but also `[za]hX`, etc. It does not match 'KA×X', ' X', or 'x-X', because the characters × (for 'times') the hyphen and the space are neither word characters nor flags.\n",
    "\n",
    "Special case: **mu-kuX**. There are multiple possible solutions for **kuX**, including kuₓ(LIL) or kuₓ(KWU147), but the very frequent form **mu-kuX** is always to be resolved **mu-kuₓ(DU)**. The regular expression `xv` in the preceding does not match hyphens and thus it will never find the key `mu-kuX` in the dictionary `xvalues`. However, this expression (meaning 'delivery') is so frequent that it makes sense to deal with it separately, rather than depend on the sign names in the `comments` column. The expression **mu-kuX** therefore, has its own line in the function."

    "For the remaining x-values (many of them ambiguous) we will copy the [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es) sign name, found in the `comments` column, to the x-value. For instance, **ummu₃** is |A.EDIN.LAL|, but the sign complex has many variants, all rendered **ummuX**: EDIN.A.SU, A.EDIN, A.EDIN.A.LAL, EDIN, etc. The code will result in ummuₓ(|A.EDIN.SU|), ummuₓ(|A.EDIN|), ummuₓ(|A.EDIN.LAL|), ummuₓ(EDIN), etc. Compound signs are put between pipes (|A.EDIN.SU|), according to [OGSL](http://oracc.org/ogsl) conventions.\n",

This will result in errors if there are more such x-values in a single line - but because we have already dealt with many such values in the preceding, that risk is not very high. The code will test that the capital X does in fact follow a sign reading (as in ziX), and is not an illegible sign (as in KA×X, or simply X). This is done with a [regular expression](https://www.regular-expressions.info/) using a so-called \"positive lookbehind\" (?<=), to see if the preceding character is a letter. The regular expression for a capital 'X' preceded by any letter valid in Sumerian or Akkadian, is compiled in the variable `lettersX` in order to speed up the process (see below: Letters)."

    "The list `flags` enumerates characters like square brackets, half-brackets and exclamation marks that may appear in a sign reading in  in [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es). The list is used in two ways. First, it is used in compiling the regular expression `xv` that will match any sign reading that ends in a capital X (see below). Second, it is used to create a table in which each flag corresponds to `None`. The `maketrans()` function is a specialized function that prepares a table that is understood by the `translate()` command. The command `translate(table)` is used in the function `ogsl_v()` (see below) to ignore any flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [regular expression](https://www.regular-expressions.info/) `xv` matches a sequence of one or more characters, immediately followed by a capital `X`. The characters allowed in the sequence are \"word\" characters (represented by `\\w`), as well as the flags. Word characters are implemented slightly differently in different programs that use regular expressions. In Python it includes the English letters of the alphabet, as well as special characters such as ṭ, ṣ, and š, but also digits (0-9) and the underscore. The `escape()` function from the `re` library supplies the proper escape character for characters in the `flags` variable that otherwise have a special function in regular expressions. For instance, the question mark, which is included in the flags, means 'zero or one time' in a regular expression. In order to match the literal question mark it should be represented as `\\?` - the `escape()` funcion takes care of that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable `letters` is a string that includes all letters that are valid in Sumerian or Akkadian, to be used in regular expressions. The variable `lettersX` is a compiled regular expression that represents a capital `X` preceded by any character in `letters`. The variable `lettersX`is a so-called look-behind expression so that the match consists only of the capital X. Similarly, the variable `lettersNo` is a compiled regular expression that represents a sequence of one or more digits (represented by `\\d+`) or capital `X` preceded by any character in `letters`. The variable `lettersno`, however, does not use the lookbehind function (which is relatively slow) because the translation affects only the digits, other characters are left unchanged.\n",
