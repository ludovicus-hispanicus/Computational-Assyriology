    "# 2.4.2 Build Sign Search for BDTNS\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal of this notebook is to build a tool for searching the [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es) data by signs, irrespective of their reading. For instance, the sign NE may be read bi₂, ne, izi, šeŋ₆, kum₂, lam₂, zah₂, etc. It is easy to search for transliteration (and/or metadata) in the [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es) search page, but there is currently no way to search for a sequence of signs. This is useful, in particular, in two situations. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sumerological transliteration conventions may differ quite substantially between different schools. Thus, lu₂ kin-gi₄-a, {lu₂}kin-gi₄-a, lu₂ kiŋ₂-gi₄-a and {lu₂}kiŋ₂-gi₄-a all represent the same sequence of signs and the same word (meaning 'messenger'), but without knowledge of the particular set of conventions used it may be difficult to guess which search will yield the desired results. In the sign search one may enter sign readings according to any convention recognized by the ORACC Global Sign List ([OGSL](http://oracc.org/ogsl)).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In some cases the correct reading and interpretation of a sign sequence may be unclear and this ambiguiuty may have been resolved in different ways throughout the database. The names lugal-mudra₅, lugal-zuluhu₂ and lugal-siki-su₁₃ all represent the same sign sequence. Which of these is correct is not entirely clear (although the third seems unlikely) and, depending on the research question, may even be unimportant (for instance for social network analysis). In the sign search one may enter any of these forms and the results will include all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will build this tool by combining the data from [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es), as prepared in the previous section, with data from the ORACC Global Sign List ([OGSL](http://oracc.org/ogsl)). The sign search is built here primarily as an example of the kinds of things one can do with data as produced in [2.4.1](2.4.1) (standardized and with proper separation between text data and non-text data).\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below will create an additional column for the [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es) data frame. This new column represents the same line of text, now as a sequence of sign names, ignoring flags (such as question marks, square brackets, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the line \n",
    "> \\[lu\\]kur-ki-ag₂ lugal \n",
    "\n",
    "is represented in the new column `sign_name` as \n",
    "\n",
    "> SAL ME KI |NINDA₂×NE| LUGAL\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create this new column the code first downloads and parses the JSON zip file that contains all the [OGSL](http://oracc.org/ogsl) data. The result is a dictionary that provides for each sign reading (key) the corresponding sign name (value). We can query this dictionary for every single sign to create the `sign_name` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compound signs are dealt with in two different ways. Compound signs that consist of a simple sequence of primary signs are analyzed, and the primary signs are returned. Thus **lukur** in the example above returns SAL ME. Other types of compound signs (for instance one sign written into another one) are not analyzed. The sign name of ag₂ is |NINDA₂×NE| and that is what is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same function that is used to transform a line of transliteration into a sequence of sign names is also used by the search engine for transforming the user input. User input is thus also transformed into a sequence of sign names, using the same [OGSL](http://oracc.org/ogsl) dictionary, and compound signs such as **lukur** are separated into their constituent signs (SAL ME). As a result, search for **lukur**, **sal-me**, or **munus išib** will all yield the same results.\n",
    "\n",
    "When searching for **sar-ki**, however, we should not find **sar kin**, in other words, the search should identify only full signs. In the `sign_name`column the sign names are separated from each other by spaces. By adding a space before and after each line in the `sign_name` column each individual sign is preceded and followed by a space, even when it appears at the beginning or the end of the line. The (transformed) search input is also put between spaces. Thus the search for \"sar-ki\" is transformed to \" SAR KI \", which does not match \" SAR KIN \"\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Regular Expressions: Look Ahead and Look Behind\n",
    ":class: tip, dropdown\n",
    "> A more common approach to the \"whole sign\" issue would be to add the regular expression \\\\b (\"word boundary\") before and after the input. However, this fails on sign names that begin and end with pipes (as in |NINDA₂×NE|), because the pipe is not considered a word character in regular expressions. It is possible to add look-behind and look-ahead regular expressions to take care of this issue. The expression would look like this: '(?:(?<=\\s)|(?<=^))'+signs+'(?=\\s|$') where `signs` represents the (transformed) search input. As it turns out, this works, but since look-behind and look-ahead expressions are relatively slow, it was decided to circumvent the problem with the extra spaces.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the output the columns `id_text`, `label` (line number), and `text` are shown (not `sign_name`). By default, the search displays only the first 25 hits and the `id_text` (the [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es) number) is used to create a link to the online edition. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{margin}\n",
    "Widgets are pieces of software that can be used to create a Graphical User Interface and allow the user to interact with the script.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The search engine uses \"widgets\" to call the search function and display the results. "

    "## 2.4.2.6 Tokenizing Signs\n",
    "In order to search by sign, we need to tokenize signs in the transliteration column (`text`) while ignoring elements such as question marks or (half-) brackets. First step is to define different types of separators, and flags that may be present in the text or in the sign name. The most common separators are space and hyphen. Curly brackets are placed around determinatives (semantic classifiers), as in {d}En-lil₂ (\"the god Enlil\"). Curly brackets and hyphens will be replaced by spaces. The separators in `separators2` are used in compound signs, as in |SI.A|, or |ŠU+NIGIN|. Operators, finally, are also used in compound signs and indicate how the signs are written in relation to each other (on top of each other, one inside the other, etc.). Compound signs that represent a sequence of simple signs (|SI.A| for **dirig** or |A.TU.GAB.LIŠ| for **asal₂**) will be decomposed in their component signs. Compound signs of the type |KA×GAR| (for **gu₇**) are not analyzed, but their component parts are aligned with [OGSL](http://oracc.org/ogsl) practices (that is |KA×NINDA| will be re-written as |KA×GAR|, because in [OGSL](http://oracc.org/ogsl) GAR is the name of the sign that can be read **ninda** or **gar**).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally the flags include various characters that may appear in the transliteration but will be ignored in the search. A search for `ninda`, therefore, will find `ninda`, `[nin]da`, `ninda?`, etc., as well as `gar`, `⸢gar⸣`, `gar!(SIG)`, etc. (but not `nagar`, see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable `flags2none` represents a table in which each character in `flags` corresponds to `None`. This is used by the `translate()` method; see below."
