# 2.4 BDTNS

```{margin}
For the numbers, see the BDTNS [about](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es/index.php?p=about) page. The [map](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es/mapa.php?modo=colecciones) gives an impression of the distribution of this corpus in libraries and collections in Europe, the Middle East, North America, China, Japan, and Australia.

The Database of Neo-Sumerian Texts ([BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es)) was created by Manuel Molina (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas). The site provides a detailed catalog of the administrative, legal, and epistolary documents from the so-called Ur III period (21st century BCE). Molina estimates that museums and private collections all over the world may hold at least 120,000 such documents, not including the holdings of the Iraq Museum, Baghdad. Currently, almost 65% of those documents are available through [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es) in transliteration, and/or in photograph and line drawing.

There is a considerable overlap in the data sets offered by [CDLI](http://cdli.ucla.edu) and [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es). All photographs and line drawings of Ur III tablets that are available in [CDLI](http://cdli.ucla.edu) have been imported into [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es); in addition, [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es) offers its own collection of thousands of photographs, in particular of tablets now in the British Museum, London. The initial core of the [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es) transliterations was provided by Remco de Maaijer and Bram Jagersma (Leiden University), who prepared tens of thousands of Ur III texts and distributed those data freely. This same set of transliterations was also one of the initial data sets of [CDLI](http://cdli.ucla.edu). Close cooperation between the two projects has led to further exchange of data. Not infrequently, therefore, misreadings or simple typos appear in the same way in both projects.

Still, [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es) is not simply a duplicate of the Ur III data in [CDLI](http://cdli.ucla.edu). Most Ur III scholars today prefer [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es) over [CDLI](http://cdli.ucla.edu) because the smaller focus of the Spanish project implies that there is more attention to detail and that more effort is made to update the record. One example is the book *Der König und sein Kreis* (2012) in which Paola Paoletti studied in detail several hundreds of documents from the so-called treasure archive at Puzriš-Dagan (see also Chapter 4). This archive reports on the manufacturing of luxury goods made of precious metals and leather and includes many rare words. Since the archive (like almost all Ur III archives) is scattered over museums all over the world, most of these texts were published as single documents or in small groups. Studying the entire group frequently allowed Paoletti to arrive at a more satisfying reading and understanding than the original editor's. The [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es) editions of these texts reflect Paoletti's improvements, but the [CDLI](http://cdli.ucla.edu) editions not (yet).

The [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es) data can be downloaded by hand through the [Search](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es/index.php?p=formulario_urIII) option in the Catalogue & Transliterations drop-down menu. One can search by a variety of criteria (including word and grapheme strings) and then download the search results by clicking on the Export button. The export page provides options for the types of information to include (various types of meta-data and/or transliterations). By searching for a blank string one may export the entire data set. The export yields two files: one for the meta-data and one for the  transliterations, both in raw text (`.txt`) format.

Currently, the export option in [BDTNS](http://bdtns.filol.csic.es) does not work. The code in 2.4.1 will grab a version of the data set, made available by Manuel Molina, from the Compass project site at Github. There is no guarantee that this is the most recent version.
